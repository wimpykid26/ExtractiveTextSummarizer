The Cleveland Cavaliers, also known as the Cavs, are an American professional basketball team based in Cleveland, Ohio. The team competes in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The team began play in 1970 as an expansion team, along with the Portland Trail Blazers and Buffalo Braves. Since 1994, home games are played at Quicken Loans Arena, which is shared with the Cleveland Gladiators of the Arena Football League and the Lake Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League.

The Cavaliers have featured many NBA stars during their history, including Austin Carr, Brad Daugherty, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Mark Price, LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love. Past NBA greats such as Nate Thurmond, Lenny Wilkens, Walt "Clyde" Frazier, and Shaquille O'Neal have also played in Cleveland, albeit near the end of their careers.

The franchise has won five Central Division championships (1976, 2009, 2010, 2015, and 2016), three Eastern Conference championships (2007, 2015, 2016), and have reached the playoffs 20 times in their 46-year history. However, the team has also had a number of dubious distinctions, such as former owner Ted Stepien's tenure, which led the NBA to create a rule regulating the trading of draft picks, known as the "Stepien Rule", and a 26-game losing streak in 2010–11, which, at the time, tied the record for the longest losing streak in major American professional sports.
